# Odyssey

Odyssey is intended to be a tool for helping you stay on track of hobbies or whatever skill you are trying to progress at

Eventually should have functionality to track progress and give suggestions for what you might be interested in learning

Inspiration for this project comes from my own habits of not knowing what to do when there's nothing to do lol

Instead of sitting trying to come up with with things to do, something like Odyssey would be a nice tool to help me 
start doing anything else instead.
